my html writeup file may need to be downloaded and opened locally; not sure why it doesn't open 
as web page from github. here is what stackoverflow sez:
The most comfortable way to preview HTML files on GitHub is to go to http://htmlpreview.github.com/ or just prepend it to the original URL, i.e.: http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/blob/master/index.html
